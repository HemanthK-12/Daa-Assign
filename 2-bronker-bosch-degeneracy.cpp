/*
- Bron Kerbosch Algorithm
- Finds all maximal cliques in graph.
- Recursive backtracking
- Has 3 parameters :
    - R = clique
    - P = All vertices adjacent to all vertices in R
        = vertices which should be considered next to check if those are also included in the clique
    - X = all vertices which SHOULD be excluded from the clique
- FIRST, we make a degeneracy ordering of the graph g=(V,E)
    - Degeneracy of a graph G=(V,E) =
