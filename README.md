# CS F364 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms
## Assignment 1 : Maximal clique Enumeration

### Dataset Preparation

- Uncompress the datasets if not already done and place them in the same folder as the code files.
- **Remove the first few comment lines** before giving them as input to the code files.
- The name of the datasets should exactly match **wiki-Vote.txt**, **email-Enron.txt** and **as-skitter.txt** respectively.


### Execution Instruction

- Before executing the code, please go to the main method of the respective file and change it to the required dataset's path.
- To execute the code in the paper "[The worst-case time complexity for generating all maximal cliques and computational experiments](<papers/The worst-case time complexity for generating all maximal cliques and computational experiments..pdf>)" , run the command : 
```
g++ 1-clique-worst-case.cpp -O3 -o 1 && ./1
```
- To execute the code in the paper "[Listing All Maximal Cliques in Sparse Graphs in Near-Optimal Time](<papers/Listing All Maximal Cliques in Sparse Graphs in Near-Optimal TIme.pdf>)", run the command : 
```
g++ 2-bron-kerbosch-degeneracy.cpp -O3 -o 2 && ./2
```
- To execute the code in the paper "[Arboricity and Subgraph Listing Algorithms](<papers/Arboricity and Subgraph Listing Algorithms.pdf>)" , run the command : 
```
g++ 3-clique-arboricity.cpp -O3 -o 3 && ./3
```
